In this context, Communication Design is used to access and understand the increasingly complex amount of data and information shaping our world. Thus, we were invited to use visualisation techniques across multiple phases of the research process: to describe and understand the observed phenomena; to share methods and results; as a strategy for public engagement.</p>

                    <p class="f5 fw3 ma0 pb3">Hate speech is a controversial and debated phenomenon, as it lies in a complex nexus with free speech. Several treaties such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) have attempted to define its contours. It is indeed a controversial term, as it is positioned in a delicate balance between freedom of expression and the respect for equality, liberty and dignity of every human being.</p>
                    <p class="f5 fw3 ma0 pb3">Legally and politically speaking there is an existing division between the American and the European approach to regulate hate speech, since the will of the United States to protect freedom of expression, as promoted by the First Amendment, has much broader boundaries than what is actually tolerated in Europe.</p>
                    <p class="f5 fw3 ma0 pb3">Moreover the internet’s speed widely spreads the phenomenon and therefore makes it difficult for the IT companies, i.e. private social platforms, to regulate online hate speech. What then bring even more issues to the matter are the dynamics through which certain types of hateful contents lead—or not— to actual acts of discrimination or violence.</p>

                    <p class="f5 fw3 ma0 pb3">In the first part of the course we found, collected and visualized <span class="underline">structured data</span> from official sources, relevant to the hate speech online phenomeon, by focusing on <span class="fw6">how IT Companies in Europe</span>, meaning private social media, <span class="fw6"> have dealt with the filtering process of hateful contents on their platforms</span>. One of the hardest battlegrounds is online, because of its intrinsic characteristics of transnationality, anonymity, unpredictability and permanence. The social networks are among the main actors in the environment that are required to manage this kind of problem.</p>
                    <p class="f5 fw3 ma0 pb3">IT Companies have their own role models—called policies—that are of course influenced by laws in Europe. These policies regulate the filtering process or the removal of improper contents from each platform. The most relevant in the EU is the Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online, that since its establishment has done 3 surveys and has published them in order to understand how IT Companies react to notifications of illegal hate speech.</p>
                    <p class="f5 fw3 ma0 pb3">The result of this first phase is the website <a class="underline-hover link no-underline dark-red" href="https://densitydesign.github.io/teaching-dd14/es01/group09/" target="_blank">404 Hate not found</a>, which contain a series of visualizations that provide a first overview of the depth and complexity of hate speech, as described by official sources. In addition to the website, we also designed a static version of the main visualization.</p>

                    <p class="f5 fw3 ma0 pb3">In the second part of the course, we faced the complexity of hate speech by mapping, collecting and analyzing online data from <span class="underline">unstructured digital sources</span>. The challange in this case was not only to find a way to visualize properly the data, but also to strictly define the protocols we used to collect all the raw material.</p>
                    <p class="f5 fw3 ma0 pb3">We tried to follow a possible path that a user could take in order to get information and form an opinion about hate speech, starting with a theoretical approach to the issue, moving to a more practical observation of the hatred phenomenon, up to analyzing which are the opinions of the users by actual observing real discussions on social platforms. In this way we tried to map the controversial debate that the Hate Speech term generates online: <span class="fw6">should this regulation of contents be considered filtering or censorship?</span></p>
                    <p class="f5 fw3 ma0 pb3">What we could deduce from such a vast phenomenon was that the discussion, rather than promoting two kind of polarizations, told instead the intrinsic nuances of the topic, making the controversy alive, understandable and debatable.</p>

                    <h2 class="serif f3 fw6 black ma0 pb1">RegulHate</h2>
                    <p class="f5 fw3 black ma0 pb3">In the third, and last, phase we were called to take a stand in the dispute and <span class="underline">design a web experience that drove a public narration</span>. Considering the conclusions and the opinions emerged during the second phase, we could deduce that the discussion was far more complex and has much broader boundaries than what we expected, underlining the fundamental question that the Hate Speech controversy generates: <span class="fw6">who should have the responsibility and the power to regulate what may or may not be said online?</span></p>
                    <p class="f5 fw3 black ma0 pb3">Starting off from this question our aim for the third and final phase of our project was to engage the public itself and give the participants an active role, in what we could define a proper call to action.</p>
                    <p class="f5 fw3 black ma0 pb3">For our concept creation we choose to use the metaphor of sound. We wanted not only to represent speech, but also to give the user the possibility to listen to it and to regulate its volume, by raising or muting it, which means giving voice or silencing it. In this way, we gave the user the possibility to try the self-regulation method by interacting with an interface inspired by music softwares, using sliders to manipulate the volume of a content, choosing how much visibility to give to it. </p>
                    <p class="f5 fw3 black ma0 pb3">In the website we proposed <span class="underline">controversial hateful contents</span> to the users, divided in four categories, that we choose from the categories of speeches that are held to be Hate Speech from the major IT Companies, as we’ve seen in Phase 01: Disability, Gender, Race, Religion. The contents were precisely found online, and this fact makes clear that they can be shared and spread in an easy way and that they can become viral. We searched for contents in social networks like Reddit, Twitter and Facebook and also in some of the RationalWiki Hate Sites that we discovered and analysed during Phase 02. We decided to work with different kinds of contents: comments, posts, memes, videos, articles and papers. All these contents have been reprocessed in order to obtain an audio file on which the user will be able to experiment by manipulating its volume. For each category we collected 6 contents to limit the fruition time of the experience, organizing them in order to recreate a stream of opinions.</p>
                    <p class="f5 fw3 black ma0 pb3">Through participation the users help to define the community standards and to create a civic moderation that will grow with the empathy and the judgment of all the different points of views and perspectives. Our intention was to show that there can be other valid solutions besides censorship, by supporting a non binary vision, by emphasizing common practice and by giving voice to all the nuances of the speech.</p>
