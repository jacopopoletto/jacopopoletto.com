                    <p class="f5 fw3 ma0 pb4"><span class="underline">We chose to focus on kids (6-10 years old) and their grandparents (60-70 years old)</span>, because we wanted to study this particular bond without taking it for granted. We wanted to know which was the gap between these two generations and explore which kind of benefits they can give to each other. So we started our research, with these goals in mind: we wanted to know when they spend time together, which kind of activities they do, which is their relationship with technology and see if there were some problems. We structured the research in three different ways: at first we did a general online survey; then, we went to two parks in Milan—Parco Indro Montanelli and Parco Sempione—asking directly to our potential users what they like to do together and if technology is somehow involved in the activities; and third, we went into the home of our users, doing for the whole afternoon some games and activities together in order to better understand the situation.</p>

                    <p class="f5 fw3 ma0 pb4">After our research, we did the <span class="fw6">personas</span>. For kids we identified <span class="underline">the leader</span>, <span class="underline">the nerdy</span> and <span class="underline">the crybaby</span>; for grandparents, <span class="underline">the innovative</span>, <span class="underline">the innovative but</span> and <span class="underline">the traditional</span>, according to their approach on technology. Thanks to the user journeys, we identified the matching couples and their main opportunities, such as finding new challenges, or to use technology to improve the experiences.</p>

                    <h2 class="serif f3 fw6 ma0 pb1">Concept</h2>
                    <p class="f5 fw3 ma0 pb3">Based on the fact that together they want to do manual activities, <span class="fw6">we focused on cooking</span>. We analyzed how the activity is carried out and we found some problems: <span class="underline">grandparents own so much knowledge in this field and they want to pass it to their grandchildren, but they need a better way to do that, so that the kid can learn better and faster</span>. So, there are some opportunities within this experience, like learning all the special family traditional recipes that only grandparents know, creating a “recipe archive” memory, storing recipes but most of all storing memories. Therefore, <span class="fw6">the project is both entertaining and educational</span>: it helps to create this “grandparents’ memory” by recording the recipe while cooking, in order to create memories for the kids’ future, saving the legacy of the family in a digital way instead of physical, simplifying the process of taking notes.</p>
    
                    <p class="f5 fw3 ma0 pb3">In details, our system is made by a <span class="fw6">smart scale</span> and an <span class="fw6">interactive app</span> that communicate with each other through wi-fi. There are three main functionalities within the system: users can <span class="underline">create</span> new recipes from scratch, they can <span class="underline">repeat</span> a recipe already saved just by following the instructions, and they can also <span class="underline">update</span> them if something has to be changed.</p>
                
                    <p class="f5 fw3 ma0 pb3">The smart scale records the weight of the ingredients and send it to the app through wi-fi connection. The user interacts with the scale by clicking the lips button in order to start weighting the ingredient: when the amount is correct, the user has to press the same button again and the eyes will change into an heart shape; there’s also an audio output that confirms that the amount was saved. At the same time, the app receives the weight data from the scale, and shows simultaneously the amount that is pourish in the scale.</p>

                    <p class="f5 fw3 ma0 pb3">The scale prototype was 3d printed in PLA material: in reality, we want the scale to be in plastic material, with a soft lips button in silicone rubber. The video below shows all the technology components that we used to design our prototype.</p>

                    <p class="f5 fw3 ma0 pv3">The video below, istead, shows the interface of the app. At the first opening, the users have to log in and create their personal profile, by adding their personal data. Then, by clicking the plus button in one of the categories, the users can add a new recipe and following the grandparents’ instructions they can select the actions and the ingredients, weight them on the scale, and the app will save all the information. Also, they can repeat a stored recipe whenever they want just by following the instructions given by the app. If they want to change something, recipes can also be updated, for example by adding another ingredient, or by changing the quantity already saved, in order to overwrite it.</p>
